# What Each File Does in the Repository:
- fractal_art_tree.py file: The very first iteration that is just an easy fractal tree, here you can adjust the tree levels and the angles
- fractal_art_snowflake.py file: Second iteration that is a simple snowflake, here you can adjust how many sides are on the snowflake and how big it is
- fractal_art_symmetrical_flower.py file: A flower that looks the same on all sides and is symmetrical through out, here you can change how many petals are on the flower and how big the flower will be
- fractal_art_spiral_flower.py file: A spiralling flower, here you can change how many petals it will draw and how large the flower/spiral will be
- colors.py file: List of HEX values that the spiral flower uses to generate the colors

# How to Run the art:
- They can be ran anyway you wish to run them and anyway you would normally run a Python script
- Once the script has started to run it will open a window on it's own to draw in by using the "turtle" module
